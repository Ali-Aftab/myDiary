# myDiary

Diary based API that utilizes Artificial Intelligence to detect the sentiment analysis of the userâ€™s diary entry. This project used Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize.

## Requirements

You need [Node.js/NPM](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed into your system. Also go to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/) to register and sign up for the free tier service for their Tone Analyzer. _Remember to get your API Key and API URL!_

## Get Started

To run this application:

1.  In your terminal type `git clone https://github.com/Ali-Aftab/myDiary.git` to clone it to your computer.
2.  Then type `cd myDiary` to access the folder
3.  To install the required modules type `npm i`
4.  Make a new PostgreSQL database by writing `createdb mydiary`
5.  Create a .env file by typing `touch .env` to store your secret keys
6.  In the .env file type
    > `SECRET_JWT_KEY=<ENTER-YOUR-KEY-HERE>` > `IBM_WATSON_API_KEY=<ENTER-YOUR-APIKEY-HERE>` > `IBM_WATSON_API_URL=<ENTER-YOUR-PERSONAL-IBM-URL-HERE>`
7.  Type `npm run start-dev` in your terminal and you can use the API!

## API

First, we recommend installing [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to easily test out the API. Remember to add `localhost:8000` to the URL before typing in the API path. (`/api/auth/signup`=>`localhost:8000/api/signup`)
